AI Gateway Ollama

AI Gateway Ollama is a lightweight, governance‑ready orchestration layer that brings auditability, rate‑limiting, access control, and developer‑friendly automation to your local or distributed Ollama environments.

It transforms Ollama from a single‑machine runtime into a production‑grade AI service.

---

🚀 What You Can Do With AI Gateway Ollama

- Run Ollama models behind a stable, versioned API
- Enforce authentication, permissions, and usage policies
- Apply rate limits, quotas, and per‑token accounting
- Capture structured logs, audit trails, and request metadata
- Integrate with CI/CD, GitHub Actions, or internal automation
- Expose multiple models as named services with consistent endpoints
- Support multi‑node or multi‑host Ollama clusters

---

🧩 Why Use a Gateway Instead of Raw Ollama?

Ollama is powerful — but it’s not designed for:

- Multi‑user access  
- Governance or compliance  
- API versioning  
- Usage tracking  
- Enterprise automation  
- Model lifecycle management  

AI Gateway Ollama fills those gaps with a modular, transparent, and auditable layer that fits cleanly into your existing infrastructure.
