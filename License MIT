### What this immediately fixes
- Clear value proposition
- 5-minute onboarding
- Explicit OpenAI compatibility
- Safer expectations for production use
- A visible roadmap (huge trust signal)

Next smart upgrades after this README:
- Add a `/health` endpoint
- Add streaming
- Add tests + GitHub Actions

When you’re ready, I can:
- Write the `/health` endpoint
- Add streaming support
- Set up CI
- Turn this into a multi-provider gateway (Ollama + OpenAI + others)

This repo is already *working*. Now it **looks** like it knows where it’s going.
